# 1. Genotype Data Preparation  

## Introduction  
We prepared the genotype data of modern and ancient target individuals whose genotype data are not available but fastq or BAM files are available.  
We used two SNP panel, 1240K(Mathieson et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2016) and Human Origins(Patterson et al., 2012; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Flegontov et al., 2017; Jeong et al., 2019).  
The genotype data of ancient individuals for the 1240K panel, excluding those for whom we took publicly available 1240K panel genotype calls,  
have been deposited in the Edmond Data Repository of the Max Planck Society [https://edmond.mpg.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17617/3.QZBM1X].
