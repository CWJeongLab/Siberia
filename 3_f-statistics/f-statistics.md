# 3. f-statistics calculation

## introduction

We calculated the f-statistics by qp3pop and f₄ functions from the R library ADMIXTOOLS2 v2.0.0. (https://github.com/uqrmaie1/admixtools, publication pending).  
We calculated outgroup-fз using the central African population Mbuti as an outgroup to measure shared genetic drift between target populations.  
Likewise, Mbuti was used as an outgroup to calculate f₄ statistics in the form of f₄(Mbuti, X; target1, target2) for testing symmetricity between targets or searching additional admixture sources.  
Populations used in f-statistics are listed in Table S2, and the results of f-statistics are summarized in Table S7-S9.
