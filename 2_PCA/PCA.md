# 2. Principal Component Analysis

## Introduction

We conducted principal components analysis (PCA) with present-day individuals genotyped on the autosomal part of the HumanOrigins array (n=593,124) using smartpca v18140 from EIGENSOFT v8.0.0 (Patterson et al., 2006).  
We used two population sets, the first including present-day Eurasian and American (2,270) and the second including Eurasian only (2,077). 
We projected ancient individuals not included in the PC calculation using the ‘lsqrproject: YES’ option. 
Samples used in PCA are listed in Table S2.
